<h1>Beyond Academics</h1>

<p>
Apart from my academic pursuits, I have actively engaged in several co-curricular
and leadership activities that have contributed to my personal and professional growth.
</p>

<p>
I have a strong interest in quizzing and have won multiple prizes in various competitions.
One of the most significant achievements in this domain was winning the
<strong>Tripurainfo Mega Quiz</strong>, a state-level quiz competition, in 2017.
</p>

<p>
During my time at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, I served as the
<strong>Head of the Mess Monitoring and Controlling Committee</strong> for two consecutive
terms (2023–2025), where I was involved in administrative coordination,
quality monitoring, and student welfare initiatives.
</p>

<p>
I also served as the <strong>Head of the Global Hyperloop Competition (GHC 1.0)</strong>
organised by the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, contributing to
event management, coordination, and large-scale technical engagement.
</p>

<p>
In my free time, I enjoy staying updated with daily news and current affairs.
I also have a keen interest in writing, which allows me to reflect on ideas,
communicate effectively, and engage with broader societal and technological developments.
